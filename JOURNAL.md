## 10/28/2025 2:33 PM - Made the schematic

I designed the schematic for my macroboard. I first added all the parts I wanted then seperated them so that i can wire it easily. I used labels to decrease the amount of wires going from the sections of parts to the microcontroller. It was a challenge at first knowing what to wire to where but I eventually figured it all out. I first had more switches and 2 rotary encoders but quickly realised the microcontroller doesnt have enough room for everything so I changed it. For my first time usign KiCad im quite happy with my final result.  

## 10/28/2025 2:36 PM - Routed the PCB

I then routed the PCB. This proved quite challenging to begin with as it was just a bunch of wires everywhere. I then slowly understood it and aligned my parts so that the wiring would be easier as they are all in order. I used a mix of front and back wires with viaducts so that it would all be able to fit. It took me 2 or 3 tries to fully get it right due to rearranging parts. The final result is a bit messy in wiring but it works for me.
