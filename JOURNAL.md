I designed the schematic for my macroboard. I first added all the parts I wanted then seperated them so that i can wire it easily. I used labels to decrease the amount of wires going from the sections of parts to the microcontroller. It was a challenge at first knowing what to wire to where but I eventually figured it all out. I first had more switches and 2 rotary encoders but quickly realised the microcontroller doesnt have enough room for everything so I changed it. For my first time usign KiCad im quite happy with my final result.
